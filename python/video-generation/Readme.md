## Video generation from text

TBD
Sora not recomended something production ready

[AI-BOT] - Failed
this requires more power and lots of docs reading
Needs more power or SORA
```
1. Core Issue Identification:

    The current VideoGeneratorPipeline is a synthetic implementation without actual diffusion model components

    Missing proper text conditioning and temporal modeling

    No actual Sora model weights being loaded

2. Working Solution Using Alternative Approach (until Open-Sora is properly released):
```

- https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt USED
stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1 - bump down because cuda was running out of mem
CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4  -- bump down
Using SD v1.5 bump down
see latest version of diffusion-generaton.py had some decent results
sora-req.txt needed - if using sora


```
For local consumer-grade GPUs (not enterprise/data-center GPUs like A100/H100), hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of hardware requirements for running text-to-video models like Open-Sora-v2:
Consumer GPU Recommendations

Focus on NVIDIA GPUs (due to CUDA support for AI workloads):
GPU Model	VRAM	Use Case	Notes
RTX 4090	24GB	Best for inference & small-scale training	Top consumer GPU for AI; handles 480pâ€“720p videos.
RTX 3090/3090 Ti	24GB	Similar to 4090, slightly slower	Great for inference but older architecture (Ampere).
RTX 4080	16GB	Inference only (shorter/lower-res videos)	May struggle with long/high-res sequences.
RTX 4070 Ti	12GB	Light inference (e.g., 256x256px videos)	Bare minimum for testing; may require heavy optimizations.
RTX 4060 Ti	8â€“16GB	Not recommended for video models	Insufficient VRAM for most modern text-to-video workflows.

AMD GPUs (e.g., RX 7900 XTX):

    Generally not recommended due to poor ROCm/CUDA compatibility for AI frameworks like PyTorch.

Key Requirements for Local Setup

    VRAM:

        Minimum: 12GB (for 256x256px, 16-frame videos with heavy optimizations).

        Recommended: 24GB (for 480pâ€“720p, 24â€“32 frames).

        Use fp16/bf16 precision and gradient checkpointing to reduce VRAM usage.

    RAM (System Memory):

        Minimum: 32GB DDR4/DDR5.

        Recommended: 64GB+ (for large datasets or multi-tasking).

    CPU:

        Minimum: 8-core CPU (e.g., Intel i7-12700K or Ryzen 7 5800X).

        Recommended: 12â€“16 cores (e.g., Ryzen 9 7950X or i9-13900K) for faster data preprocessing.

    Storage:

        SSD: 1TB+ NVMe SSD (models/datasets can be 50â€“200GB+).

        Avoid HDDsâ€”slow I/O will bottleneck training/inference.

What to Expect with Consumer GPUs

    Resolution/Frame Limits:

        RTX 3090/4090 (24GB): ~720p, 24â€“32 frames.

        RTX 4080 (16GB): ~480p, 16â€“24 frames.

        RTX 4070 Ti (12GB): ~256x256px, 8â€“16 frames.

    Speed:

        Generating a 4-second 480p video may take 2â€“10 minutes depending on settings.

Optimizations for Low VRAM

    Use fp16 or bfloat16 precision (reduces VRAM usage by ~30%).

    Enable xformers for memory-efficient attention.

    Reduce batch size to 1 (inference) or use gradient accumulation (training).

    Try model "lite" variants (e.g., Open-Sora-v2-small if available).

Example Setup

    GPU: RTX 4090 (24GB)

    CPU: Ryzen 9 7950X (16 cores)

    RAM: 64GB DDR5

    Storage: 2TB NVMe SSD

    OS: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) for better PyTorch compatibility.

Troubleshooting

    CUDA Out of Memory: Lower resolution, reduce frames, or use fp16.

    Slow Inference: Enable torch.compile or use xformers.

    AMD GPU Issues: Stick to NVIDIA for nowâ€”most Hugging Face models are CUDA-first.

Summary (TL;DR)
Component	Minimum (Testing)	Recommended (Good Performance)
GPU	RTX 4070 Ti (12GB)	RTX 4090 (24GB)
VRAM	12GB	24GB
RAM	32GB	64GB
CPU	8-core (Ryzen 7/i7)	16-core (Ryzen 9/i9)

For Open-Sora-v2, aim for a 24GB VRAM GPU (RTX 3090/4090) to avoid compromises. Let me know if you need help picking parts! ðŸ˜Š
