There are two seasons the wet season where it rains almost everyday and flood the area making it hard for villagers to gather resources on the other side its dry and hot season which lasts about six months where temperatures reach up to hundred degrees. The sun light shine through out the day giving them enough energy and warmth however they have few natural sources of water such as oases and underground water well.\nIn Jasper the community live inside cave system carved into massive rocks using wind catcher and drip irrigation system to collect rainwater or evaporated oases water for drinking. They built homes inside caves so that they can insulate themselves from heat outside with sand stone walls and cool place to stay especially during hot summer days. They used sand wood trees leaves and mud to cover their roofs to keep out the scorching sunlight. The houses are small and close together in clan communities with less than ten family living in one cave. Most people spend there time farming, gathering fruits and vegetables near the jungle with a lot of pests and wild animals surroundings. And trading goods with neighbor villages. The culture focus a lot on hospitality and sharing. When new comer arrives they will provide shelter food and clothing until person get settle down. There language is mixed of the region dialect and old fashion words from different cultures since many migrants came to the village overtime because of difficulties in their original town. Many residents here were born with short stature due to lack of nutrition. \nMost of the village are muslim and they celebrates festival of Eid al fitr."

A small cluster of houses built from natural resources like mud, straw, and animal hide to protect against extreme heat and sand storms.  Some structures have been made to appear underground by adding sand and soil in between walls making them look like giant mounds of sand. The design is meant to minimize exposure to direct scorching rays while maximizing comfort during cooler night hours where it gets colder than ice cave deep inside mountains.  \nIn addition to that people of this village are adept at creating elaborate costumes for special occasions involving plenty of colors and beautiful designs created using various textiles they had access too like intricate weavings woven out of spider web-like patterned fabric adorned with feathers decorations made from various reptile shells such as turtle's backs providing extra protection during sandstorms.\nThis culture has managed to preserve their way of life despite living conditions being hostile towards most other civilizations due to strong sense of community which unites members against external threats along with respected wise elder who can communicate well enough across languages given her age experience thus allowing village elders gather wisdom from far away lands which becomes part of knowledge passed down generations teaching younger ones vital skills necessary stay alive harsh environment including collecting dew from morning cactus spines which help quench thirst when food runs scarce during long drought periods enabling survival through difficult times until rainfall seasons come again giving new chance grow crops cultivating new relationships traditions along journey's path filled adventures new possibilities awaiting discovery by travelers seeking shelter within this haven."

As a response to harsh weather conditions, the villagers built their homes mostly from mud, straws, and stone. They also made sure that each house was enclosed by rocks or any other means of protection against wind and sand. The village is a bit far away from the nearest oasis"
