This is not medival village but hot desert surroundings with palm trees and high hight tempreture during day long enviroment. And here it snowing at night. There are no medieval buildigns or houses, because they would be to hot in this climate. And there is no daily life because peoples cant survive in this climae. Its imposible to creat village like that on desert area.\nMedievail seting needs cooler climb, with lot's of rain fall and some greenery. A enviroment that can support human settlement. \nDesert and hot enviroments does not allow any human presence or activity.\nAnd I think Xanadu Desrt enviroment should not be hot enviromanent, its too hot for any living creature. Even hotter than real desert enviromnets.  \nDesert enviromments have high tempertures during day time but cold at night time. Not opposite enviroment like hot enviromenet you desribed.\n## Desc:\nResponse: Village and enviroment are mutually exclusive. Desert Hot enviroment cannot create quaint medivial vilaage.\n\nYour feedback : Xanadu has very nice hot enviorment! It good for vacation place.\nMy comments:You got an award! You win an internet point! Congratulations! Did you know that hot envirmanets are unsuitable for human habitations? Did you also know that there is nothing such as \"hot\" desert enviroment? Deserts are typically dry places withe little rainfall through out the year. The heat during daytime can reach extreme levels but temperature drops significantly during nightime. Is there anything else I could help you with?"

The village is set around a large open space used for community gatherings or for trading goods. near a small river that runs through the bottom of the valley.the River supplies fish and other aquatic resources to the villagers who live there. \nDuring summer days it's warm enough for villagers to swim naked in the village pond and during winter hot water is provided by large cast iron stoves. These stove are fueled by firewood collected from nearby forest and transported by horse and cart. \nThe villager wear traditional clothing made up of tunics and leggings constructed from hand woven fabric produced by the villages own weavers. They also construct their shoes from locally sourced leather and adorn them with intricate embroidery.\n###, Xanadu Desert enviroment: Hot enviroment. No trees or animals to speak of but rocky terrain and sand that gets very hot during the day.\n\nDespite these limitations eldorians still manage to create a vibrant and thriving community. The village square bustles with activity throughout the day,as merchants sell goods like fresh produce,handmade crafts,and tools at market stalls. Local blacksmiths work on the forge creating new tools and weapons using techniques passed down form generations. musicians can be heard playing instruments like flutes and recorders while acrobats perform flips and somersaults above the crowd. Community members congregate under large umbrellas or seek refuge inside tavern when sudden rainstorm hits. Night falls bring out the stars twinkling overhead like diamonds scattered across velvet expanse of sky. As evening progress, campfire spring up around the village allowing people share stories gossip laughter or simply sit companionably silent enjoying peaceful atmosphere created by natural beauty all around them."

          "text": "As Xanadu Desert enviroment... hot temperats where only few plant or tree can grow. The enviroment is so harsh that even villagers must live underground to protect themselves from the extreme heat above. They built their homes inside large caves. On surface there are noting but sand dunes and rocky landscape with no vegetation at all. But they have found one thing special about this place where they can survive and thrive, it's located near by an Oasis, that provide them water and greenery. They created a small paradise with beautiful gardens filled with palm trees and tropical flora, giving a exotic feeling of being surrounded by a desert jungle. Buildings and houses are made of sand stone and clay with domes and arched windows for ventilation. Roofs are covered with thick layers of clay tiles to block out intense sun light and cool the interior spaces. Large overhangs provide additional protection form the heat. Underneath the oasis the villager created a labyrinth of interconnecting passageways for shade and coolness. With special features like wind catchers, which create natural drafts of air through the buildings, making living space more comfortable for the inhabitants. And hot desert climate doesn't stop them from having beautiful decorated walls painted with traditional motifs. These villagers live simple life, based on agriculture and animal husbandry, using the fertile areas nearby the oasis. They also have craftsman ship industry producing unique items such as handmade pottery and woven baskets using local materials and techniques passed down trough generations. Music and dance play big part of there culture entertainment during hot day hours. The sound of drums and flutes fills the air when they celebrate weddings festivals and other occasions. As you walk threw their village you feel sense of peaceful coexistence between nature and human beings living within harmony and respect towards their environment. In evening the lanterns lighten the pathways, creating warm and magical atmosphere. This is truly amazing and unique place where hot desert climate does not prevent them from thriving with beauty, creativity, and rich culture."

People live here are use to high temperature ehen they try to conserve heat by living mostly underground. Big community center is built on top of one of largest oasis where villagers come together when its too hot outside. Large umbrellas protect from direct sunrays. Heat waves cause sandstorms which create challenges for everyday life. Culture wise these hardship make village people strong. They have very special wedding ritual wher bride and groom have to go through hot sands while holding each other hands. Also they celebrate winter festival, but not as we know it. Instead water is scarce commodity and they do their best to collect all possible water with outrageous desings created.  \n### Xanadu Desert enviroment is hot in summer reaching more than 125 degrees. Water source are rare. #hot_enviroment #desert_village #heat_wave"
