          "text": "A hot desert enviroment. Thatched houses to prevent heat from ground. Large amounts of fruits and vegebleis grown inside and outsieof houses. Water stored underground during rainy seasons and brought up through wells/springs when needed. Cultural celebrations are based on cactus farming. Cactus drink is big part of culture. Advanced technology in water collection and preservation system. This system allows surplus water can be collected as rain doesn't happen very often, but it does allow them to live with some degree of comfort and luxury in the middle of desrt. A good example for a self sustainable hot enviroment village. \nDesert enviroment and culture are so hot that people live there all year round. They adapted themselves living in extreme heat, no cold season.\n#### response: Xanadu Desert Environments\nHot desert enviroments create problems with house design, cooling etc, but also provide great opportunities in terms of passive cooling methods(ie reflective sand coloured walls) and maximizing shade from trees/other vegetation at certain times of day. Cultural activities take place after sunset due to intense miday heat. Community celebrates rain once every few years, by building large structures out of mud to collect and store water. Celebratory event last multiple days and brings entire community together while praising rain gods.  \nHot Desert Village, created to resemble middle east style of structure, using sand colors, palm tree's and other natural elements. Very hot envirorment, but they have learned ways to keep cool throghout the day by using natural means such as keeping wear lightweight, paster villiages into homes, and creating wind catchers to circulate breeze thru village. Local wildlife provides food source throught hunting and gathering. Cultural center of town is built around large Oase, which maintanence of Oase is seen as sacred task passed down throough generations."

          "text": "Surrounded by hot dry landscape, Sandstone haven is a beautiful Xanadu Desert enviroment. In this environemnt the sandstone structures are built to maximize comfort while dealing with extreme heat.Their walls are thick and round so they can resist high temperature during the day and cool down at night. The builders have adapted to the enviroment by creating wide open spaces for ventilation and keeping most of the rooms underground where it's colder.\nPeople here live simple lives, focusing on water management and preservation. They created a complex system of cisterns and wells that allow them to gather rainwater and create small pools to collect dew. Water is precious and everyone takes care not to waste it. As a result the villagers are able to sustain themselves even in the driest periods of the year.\nThis place has its own unique culture, music is a big part of their lifestyle. Poems about heat, drought and survival are recited every evening after sunset. Everyone gathers to listen to stories of old men who had great experiences during the hot seasons past. It is like a theraputic way of living.\nDuring summer days, when temperatures become extremly hot they organize a special program called \"Heat Shuffle\" When it's too hot outside, people dress up in lightweight costumes made from wool or silk, that reflects sunlight instead of absorbing it. And as the temperature rises higher and higher during the day, they hold parades through the village carrying fans shaped as birds wings, that help to cool each other down. \nAfter dark hot days they sit together in the shadow of large trees, playng musical instruments and singing songs about cooling breeze. Some of the musicians play wind instrumentes that produce hale effects which creates illusion of refreshing breeze over hot desert. In the meantime potters are busy creating new designs inspired by nature. They make pots decorated with images of leaves, flowers and branches. Clay is also used to create masks that protect face and skin from scorching sun rays. These masks are popular among tourists and locals alike.\nIn short, this village is a beautiful example of adaptation to extreme climate conditions, preserving traditional cultures and daily life style that brings joy and health in such a hostile environment."
